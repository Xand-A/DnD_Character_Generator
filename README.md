Project to develop the basics of a lvl 1 character for DnD 5e randomly to practice Python coding and get an introduction to build a steamlit app 

Characters are randomly generated by 'rolling' a die - for more info on functions used see [defined](./defined) folder :game_die:

## Generate your own character

## Next steps

- With the development of AI, notably ChatGPT, I'd like to make a randomised character backstory via API call out to flesh out character 
- Add weapons, background and armour
- Add AC
